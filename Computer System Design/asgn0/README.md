dog.c program is another way to show cat command, it is used to display the content of the files using syscalls like open(), read(), write() and close. In order to run the program, type "gcc dog.c -o dog", and then "./dog [filename]", and it will display the content of the files. I tested the program with text file, non-text file, with filename, without filename, and '-', all of them worked good.
